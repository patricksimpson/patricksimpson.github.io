<p>Click a gray space, then pick a color on the left. Once you have 4 color spaces, press “score” to see your score for that row. For more detailed instructions: https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Mastermind</p>

<h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>

<p>Each white peg means that one of the guessed pegs is correct, but is in the wrong hole. Each red (or black) peg means that one of the guessed pegs is correct, and is in the right hole. The order of the white and black pegs does not matter.</p>

<h2 id="end">End</h2>

<p>If you guess the correct code, you win!</p>
