title: Action > Words
---

This [recent article by DHH](https://world.hey.com/dhh/actions-beat-arguments-2aa1da34) resonates with me pretty significantly, actions > arguments. 

As my mom put it... “actions speak louder than words.”

One thing I notice, when it comes to engineering teams, is that _doing_ beats _talking_. Many organizations (think big corporations) are paralyzed by **non-action**, or too many words spoken and not enough fingers on keyboards. 
The ‘bloatifcation’ of engineering teams eventually grinds down action. A lot of talk and not a lot of doing...

This is another reason why I chose to work for a start-up. If you _say_ you're going to do something, make sure you follow through with **action**.
