title: I Follow
---

I recently lost a link to an article here in this document. It drove me crazy but I managed to find it after about an hour of searching chat histories and gitlogs... oof.
I now feel compelled to keep some kind of on going list of articles, people and resources that have helped shape my thinking around engineering.

So, here's the list, from favorite posts, people I follow/read, and resources I use. Enjoy.
