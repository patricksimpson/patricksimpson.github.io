I"…<p>This <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/actions-beat-arguments-2aa1da34">recent article by DHH</a> resonates with me pretty significantly, actions &gt; arguments.</p>

<p>As my mom put it‚Ä¶ ‚Äúactions speak louder than words.‚Äù</p>

<p>One thing I notice, when it comes to engineering teams, is that <em>doing</em> beats <em>talking</em>. Many organizations (think big corporations) are paralyzed by <strong>non-action</strong>, or too many words spoken and not enough fingers on keyboards. 
The ‚Äòbloatifcation‚Äô of engineering teams eventually grinds down action. A lot of talk and not a lot of doing‚Ä¶</p>

<p>This is another reason why I chose to work for a start-up. If you <em>say</em> you‚Äôre going to do something, make sure you follow through with <strong>action</strong>.</p>
