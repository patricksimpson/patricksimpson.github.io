## ~ 2002 - 2003

A "free" web hosting website. My first large web project. The project suffered a catastrophic
end after massing thousands of users (most of which were repeat and/or fake), all user data was deleted either by accident or from malicious code (exploited).

This project was co-authored by my friends at the time during college and while working as a tech at Sinclair Community
College. A lot of credit goes to them for getting me past my initial road blocks, mostly around server administration (linux, devops, etc.)

I learned a lot and zeroed in on my career path during this process.

You can see it on the web archive to this day. But many of the older frames
are being removed. I am going to capture some of them here as part of this project.

## Tech Used

- PHP
- Linux
- Apache Web Server
