<p>Hi there, it’s been 20 years…
izerop was first launched in 2003, with the help of my friends before my 18th birthday. The project, at the time, lasted about a year before it came to an end. 
The saga didn’t truly end, the idea has stuck with me over these years. It’s become more than just a forgotten project.</p>

<p>Today, I am announcing a beta launch of the project to a wider audience. Feel free to join and help me solidify this product.</p>

<p>See it live https://izerop.com</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
