  <p>Finding out about <a href="https://help.heroku.com/RSBRUH58/removal-of-heroku-free-product-plans-faq">Heroku removing the free tier</a> does sting a bit. Being one of the first PaaS services I ever used, itâ€™s a little sad to see it go. I wonder if free PaaS is a pipe dream? At some point <em>free</em> becomes impossible. I am sure there will be others to give it a shotâ€¦ but for how long? We need to be able to be flexible, learn to pivot if need be or just pay up. 
So, hereâ€™s one â˜• Heroku, thanks for making your free tier service, it was great while it lasted.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>

<h3 id="render">Render</h3>

<p>I have not used Render, but it looks like it can do just about all what Heroku does (Host rails, php, nodejs, etc.. with a free tier).</p>

<h3 id="aws">AWS</h3>

<p>Aws has a free tier. It might more complex, but you can get something up and running for free using a myriad of services:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk">AWS BeanStalk</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">AWS S3</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2">AWS EC2</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds">AWS RDS</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="netlify">Netlify</h3>

<p>Reminds me of Divshot ðŸª¦ (who remembers that?) great for static hosting, free.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">https://www.netlify.com/</a></p>

<h3 id="github-pages">Github Pages</h3>

<p>I personally use Github Pages. Itâ€™s great, itâ€™s fast and easy to get your static store hosted!</p>
