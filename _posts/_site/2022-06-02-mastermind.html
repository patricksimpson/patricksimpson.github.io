<p>My kids and I love to play games, one of our favorites is Mastermind.
Unfortunately, we were missing lots of pegs… We’d come up with interesting ways to account for this, in which inspired me to write our own version. We’d love to share it with you…</p>

<p>Click a gray space, then pick a color on the left. Once you have 4 color spaces, press “score” to see your score for that row. For more detailed instructions: https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Mastermind</p>

<h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>

<p>Each white peg means that one of the guessed pegs is correct, but is in the wrong hole. Each red (or black) peg means that one of the guessed pegs is correct, and is in the right hole. The order of the white and black pegs does not matter.</p>

<p>If you guess the correct code, you win!</p>
