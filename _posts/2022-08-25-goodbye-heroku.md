Finding out about [Heroku removing the free tier](https://help.heroku.com/RSBRUH58/removal-of-heroku-free-product-plans-faq) does sting a bit. Being one of the first PaaS services I ever used, itâ€™s a little sad to see it go. I wonder if free PaaS is a pipe dream? At some point _free_ becomes impossible. I am sure there will be others to give it a shot... but for how long? We need to be able to be flexible, learn to pivot if need be or just pay up. 
So, hereâ€™s one â˜• Heroku, thanks for making your free tier service, it was great while it lasted. 

## Alternatives

### Render

I have not used Render, but it looks like it can do just about all what Heroku does (Host rails, php, nodejs, etc.. with a free tier).

### AWS

Aws has a free tier. It might more complex, but you can get something up and running for free using a myriad of services:

- [AWS BeanStalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk)
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3)
- [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2)
- [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds)

### Netlify

Reminds me of Divshot ðŸª¦ (who remembers that?) great for static hosting, free.

### Github Pages

I personally use Github Pages. Itâ€™s great, itâ€™s fast and easy to get your static store hosted!
