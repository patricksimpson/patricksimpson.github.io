<blockquote>
  <p>Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty…
– Theodore Roosevelt.</p>

<p>To learn and grow, you must stretch yourself beyond your capabilities.</p>

<p>Your mind and your body grow the same way. Apply yourself to hard things.</p>

<p>Remember this next time you seek the “easy” thing.</p>
