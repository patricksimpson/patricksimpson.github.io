My kids and I love to play games, one of our favorites is Mastermind.
Unfortunately, we were missing lots of pegs... We'd come up with interesting ways to account for this, in which inspired me to write our own version. We'd love to share it with you...

[Play Mastermind](https://patricksimpson.me/mastermind) 

It's open source on [github](https://github.com/patricksimpson/mastermind)!

## How to play

Click a gray space, then pick a color on the left. Once you have 4 color spaces, press "score" to see your score for that row. For more detailed instructions: https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Mastermind

## Scoring

Each white peg means that one of the guessed pegs is correct, but is in the wrong hole. Each red (or black) peg means that one of the guessed pegs is correct, and is in the right hole. The order of the white and black pegs does not matter.

## End

If you guess the correct code, you win!

## Restart

Refresh your browser for a new game.
