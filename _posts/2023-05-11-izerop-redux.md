title: izerop redux

Hi there, it's been 20 years...

izerop was [first launched in 2003](/projects/izerop-v1), with the help of my friends before my 18th birthday. The project, at the time, lasted about a year before it came to an abrupt end.
However, the saga continues... 

Today, I am announcing a beta launch of the project to a wider audience. Feel free to join and help me solidify this product.

See it live @ [izerop.com](https://izerop.com)

Thank you!
