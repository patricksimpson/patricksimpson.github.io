I"£<p>This <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/actions-beat-arguments-2aa1da34">recent article by DHH</a> resonates with me pretty significantly, actions &gt; arguments.</p>

<p>As my mom put it‚Ä¶ ‚Äúactions speak louder than words.‚Äù</p>

<p>When it comes to engineering, <em>doing</em> beats <em>talking</em>. Many organizations (think big corporations) are paralyzed by <strong>non-action</strong>, or too many words spoken and not enough fingers on keyboards.</p>

<p>The ‚Äòbloatifcation‚Äô of engineering teams starts by inaction, a lot of talk, not a lot of doing. What happens after, is anyone‚Äôs guess.</p>

<p>Talk is cheap. If you <em>say</em> you‚Äôre going to do something, make sure you follow through with <strong>action</strong>.</p>
